#GLandbox

GLandbox is, for the moment, little more than my personal API for making OpenGL experiments faster and more easily. As I learn more of how OpenGL works, I might eventually polish it to make a good sandboxing framework out of it.
Currently it is in very early stages and of not of any use to anyone willing to undertake an actual
OpenGL project. It is maybe too early even for a quick pull and test. It is neither well documented nor tested yet, so if you are interested I recommend that you wait a little bit before you try it out.

##Examples
In the examples directory you will find a bunch of examples that make use of the framework. Some of them are based on the 6th edition of the excellent OpenGL SuperBible. Some of these examples are not yet fully functional or present some issues, but they can provide quick pointers on how to use the API.
